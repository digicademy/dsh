DSH
===

This extension provides quality assurance (QA) routines for data stored in
TYPO3 systems. This can be helpful in case a table configuration (TCA)
needs to be flexible but editors should adhere to specific guidelines when
they add or edit data. The extension allows you to configure scheduled or
manually triggered tasks that check custom patterns across tables and
fields. QA information may also be collected in dshboards that help editors
find and complete faulty data. DSH is compatible with, but not explicitly a
part of, the Cultural Heritage Framework (CHF), a research software suite
that helps you build web apps to produce and publish data in the humanities.
